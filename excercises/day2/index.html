        <p class="top-5__header">Praha [ˈpraɦa] (listen); German: Prag, pronounced [pʁaːk] (listen); Latin: Praga) is the
        capital and largest city in the Czech Republic,[8] and the historical capital of Bohemia. On the Vltava river, Prague is
        home to about 1.3 million people.[4] The city has a temperate oceanic climate, with relatively warm summers and chilly
        winters.
        
        Prague is a political, cultural, and economic hub of central Europe, with a rich history and Romanesque, Gothic,
        Renaissance and Baroque architectures. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia and residence of several Holy Roman
        Emperors, most notably Charles IV (r. 1346–1378).[9]
        
        It was an important city to the Habsburg monarchy and Austro-Hungarian Empire. The city played major roles in the
        Bohemian and the Protestant Reformations, the Thirty Years' War and in 20th-century history as the capital of
        Czechoslovakia between the World Wars and the post-war Communist era
