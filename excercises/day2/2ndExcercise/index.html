   <ul>
       <li>Why should you care about how your code is formatted?</li>
    It aims at improving collaboration, code quality, and enabling supporting infrastructure.
    
       <li>How many spaces should you indent at a time?</li>
    by 2 spaces at a time
       <li> Should the code be lowercase or uppercase?</li>
    All code has to be lowercase: This applies to HTML element names, attributes, attribute values (unless text/CDATA), CSS
    selectors, properties, and property values (with the exception of strings).
       <li> What is the recommended encoding?</li>
    UTF-8 (no BOM).
       <li> How should you use comment to explain your code? How do you do it in HTML and in CSS?</li>
    Explain code as needed, where possible.    
    Use comments to explain code: What does it cover, what purpose does it serve, why is respective solution used or
    preferred?
       <li>How do you validate your HTML?</li>
    Use tools such as the W3C HTML validator to test.
       <li>What is the purpose of the alt attribute?</li>
    For multimedia, such as images, videos, animated objects via canvas, make sure to offer alternative access. For images
    that means use of meaningful alternative text (alt) and for video and audio transcripts and captions, if available.
       <li>Should you separate structure (markup), presentation (styling), and behavior (scripting)? If yes, why?</li>
    Strictly keep structure (markup), presentation (styling), and behavior (scripting) apart, and try to keep the
    interaction between the three to an absolute minimum.
       <li>Should you use double or single quotation marks around attribute values?</li>
    When quoting attributes values, use double quotation marks.
       <li>How can you validate your CSS code?</li>
    Use tools such as the W3C CSS validator to test.
       <li>When would you use meaningful ID/class names? When would you use generic ones?</li>
    Names that are specific and reflect the purpose of the element should be preferred as these are most understandable and
    the least likely to change. Generic names are simply a fallback for elements that have no particular or no meaning
    different from their siblings.
    They are typically needed as “helpers.“
